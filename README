--- Description ---
This application is multi-platform wallpaper changer. It can change your wallpaper depending on daytime, (date, weather not implemented yet).

I hope it will have gui in future, for now it works from command line only.

Main trouble is discovering how to change wallpaper on certain system or window manager, so I made it simple if someone knows how to change it,
just write a super simple plugin, that can do that, so everyone can enjoy it :)

You can use it to generate fractals or something like that using python imaging library and then use this application to set it as wallpaper, with
some conditions, there are no limits to ones imagination.



--- Plugins ---
name pluigns so they would correspand to settings.window_managers key and environment_detector ('gnome.py', 'kde.py', 'windows.py', 'macos.py')

each plugin contains one class with method set_wallpaper that takes wallpaper image file with absolute or relative path and sets it as a desktop.
method needs to return True if succes or False on error.
class needs to inherit from common.BaseClass and needs to have same name as the plugins name

class can then access logging in self.log and datetime in self.datetime

if you need to override __init__(self), make sure to call super(classname, self).__init__()!

Example:
'mywindowmanager.py'
-----------------------------------------
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import os

from common import BaseClass

class mywindowmanager(BaseClass): # name class same way as file!
	
	def set_wallpaper(image_file_with_path):
		filepath = os.path.abspath(image_file_with_path)
		
		try:
			# try to set wallpaper
			# NOTE: this will work, but there is no way of telling if wallpaper was set or not, and also Exception below would occur only if imgfile would
			# be something horrible, so almost never
			call(['feh', '--bg-fill', imgfile])
			return True
		
		except Exception, e:
			self.log.error('%s Error while setting wallpaper image: %s, error was: %s' % (self.datetime.datetime.now(), image_file_with_path, e))
			return False
