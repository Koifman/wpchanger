1) install dependencies:
    # pip install -r REQUIREMENTS

2) configure settings to correct paths 
    just set wallpaper_image variable in settings to correct path should be enough

3) OPTIONAL
    find some nice wallpapers that can be used with this program (only if you don't like these few that come with this program)
    set images_dir to path where these wallpapers are located in

4) run run.py
    # ./run.py


On some systems (window managers) you need to manually point your system to the resulting wallpaper, because there is no API (I could find) for doing it programmatically (like KDE).
That means path you set up earlier (wallpaper_image) is where the result will be saved, so point your os to it.

Other window managers - like i3wm or gnome provide API that will do it for you, you don't need to take care of anything except settings.
